After adding several components for UI parts to my storybook Buttons, Titles, etc. and components that corresponds to specific application logic custom Lists and Forms, Charts etc. I understand that mixing all of these components in one place looks messy.

After a small research, I found a few good structured examples, [WixStyleReact](https://wix-style-react.now.sh/?path=/story/introduction-getting-started--getting-started) and [Lucid UI](https://appnexus.github.io/lucid/?path=/docs/visualizations-bars--basic), that helps
me to understand how to structure my storybook navigation:

**WixStyleReact**

<ImgWrapper width={400}>

![](/wix-navigation.png)

</ImgWrapper>

To creating High Level navigation header, we are using this syntax:

```jsx
WIX screenshot  (Introduction section):
'Introduction|Getting Started',
'Introduction|Playground',
...
```

Code of our storie, will look like:

```jsx
// GettingStarded.stories.js
import React from "react";
import GettingStarded from "./GettingStarded";

export default {
  title: "Introduction|Getting Started",
};

export const Default = () => <GettingStarded />;
```

If we want to make a folder with a list of components, just add one more subdirectory using slash (`/`) symbol. Will be looking like this:

```jsx
WIX screenshot (Components API section):
'Components API|Components/Form'
'Components API|Components/Modal'
...
```

Code of our storie, will look like:

```jsx
// GettingStarded.stories.js
import React from "react";
import Form from "./components/Form";

export default {
  title: "Components API|Components/Form",
};

export const Default = () => <Form />;
```

If you wanna read more about this pattern, here is link on the official documentation [Story hierarchy](https://storybook.js.org/docs/basics/writing-stories/#story-hierarchy).

One more example of components library:

**Lucid UI**

<ImgWrapper width={400}>

![Lucid UI](/lucidui-navigation.png)

</ImgWrapper>
