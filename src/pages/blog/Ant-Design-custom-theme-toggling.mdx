title: Ant Design toggling dynamically custom theme
date: 2020-08-02

Hey there who are using ant design, If you wanna add one more theme to your application, this information can be useful.
When I faced this task I think that it would be easy solution because antd has a configuration with variables and support it in dynamically should be ease. But I forgot for the .less and live compilation for the product. And as an additional, I'm using a create react app, that hasn't access to the webpack configuration from the box.

### Tools

During some research and googling, was find several examples and articles that already solving this problem.

Most common solution that I've met its npm module: [https://github.com/mzohaibqc/antd-theme-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/mzohaibqc/antd-theme-webpack-plugin)

Here is one alternative package: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/antd-theme-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/antd-theme-generator) , I haven't tried antd-theme-generator, who wants to try alternative here is a article with example how to configure: [https://annacoding.com/article/gVcF6qCZkfnM3JOnPxBqx/Change-Ant-Design-Theme-dynamically-in-React-Create-React-App](https://annacoding.com/article/gVcF6qCZkfnM3JOnPxBqx/Change-Ant-Design-Theme-dynamically-in-React-Create-React-App)

And to implement both of these solutions with Create react app we need, add additional webpack configuration module `customize-cra`.

### Solution

Main packages that I'm using:

1. antd v3 (with **v4** works the same)
2. customize-cra
3. create-react-app
4. antd-theme-webpack-plugin

**Project Configuration**

To our root directory we are adding file `config-overrides.js`

```jsx
//config-overrides.js

const path = require("path");
const {
  override,
  fixBabelImports,
  addLessLoader,
  addWebpackPlugin,
} = require("customize-cra");
const AntDesignThemePlugin = require("antd-theme-webpack-plugin");

const options = {
  stylesDir: path.join(__dirname, "./src/antd-custom-style"),
  antDir: path.join(__dirname, "./node_modules/antd"),
  varFile: path.join(__dirname, "./src/antd-custom-style/vars.less"),
  // list of variables that will be listening
  themeVariables: ["@primary-color", "@body-background"],
  generateOnce: false, // generate color.less on each compilation
};

module.exports = override(
  fixBabelImports("import", {
    libraryName: "antd",
    libraryDirectory: "es",
    style: true,
  }),

  addWebpackPlugin(new AntDesignThemePlugin(options)),

  addLessLoader({
    javascriptEnabled: true,
  })
);
```

> themeVariables: ['@primary-color', '@body-background'] depends on our example application will be listening just these two variables

You can generate a list of all antd variables and paste it to the `themeVariables` field, here is code implementation example from antd-theme-webpack-plugin : [https://github.com/mzohaibqc/antd-theme-webpack-plugin/blob/ebc9eb92c9ea7cbe3e703470bfc9ede131a7f2cc/examples/customize-cra/config-overrides.js#L21](https://github.com/mzohaibqc/antd-theme-webpack-plugin/blob/ebc9eb92c9ea7cbe3e703470bfc9ede131a7f2cc/examples/customize-cra/config-overrides.js#L21)

Main fields that should be configured depending on your project `varFile`, `stylesDir`, `themeVariables`, everything else it's boilerplate.

**Add toggler inside the Component**

To any of your component add this two button, two trigger theme dynamic

```jsx
<button
  type="button"
  onClick={() => {
    window.less.modifyVars({
      '@primary-color': 'red',
      '@body-background': 'yellow',
    });
  }}
>
  Red Theme
</button>
<button
  type="button"
  onClick={() => {
    window.less.modifyVars({
      '@primary-color': 'blue',
      '@body-background': 'purple',
    });
  }}
>
  Blue Theme
</button>
```

In multiple sources, I was found examples of where to the `/public` folder was added `color.less`, I cannot reproduce this examples, there were some mistakes, I assume it's a pretty old approach.

That's all now you have antd with ability to configure theming dynamically and improve you user experience.
